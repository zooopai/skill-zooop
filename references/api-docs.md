# ZOOOP Public REST API (v1)

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Create a Personal Access Token at https://zooop.ai/user#apiKeys
export ZOOOP_API_KEY=zpk_live_...

# (Quote every URL: zsh treats `?` as a glob and `&` as a job separator.)

# 2. Discover models for the kind of task you want
curl -fsS -H "Authorization: Bearer $ZOOOP_API_KEY" \
  "https://api.zooop.ai/v1/models?type=image&subtype=default"

# 3. Submit a task with one of the model ids + a version id
curl -fsS -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $ZOOOP_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"interfaceId":"<uuid>","versionId":"standard","params":{"prompt":"a red panda"}}' \
  "https://api.zooop.ai/v1/tasks"

# 4. Poll for the result
curl -fsS -H "Authorization: Bearer $ZOOOP_API_KEY" \
  "https://api.zooop.ai/v1/tasks/<taskId>"
```

## Authentication

All endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <PAT>`. Tokens look like
`zpk_live_<32 chars>` and are created at <https://zooop.ai/user#apiKeys>. The
plaintext is shown ONCE at creation; afterwards only the leading prefix is
visible in the settings UI. To rotate, create a new token and revoke the old
one (revocation is immediate).

The token's user owns every task it submits and every file it uploads.
Credits are debited from that user's personal balance.

**Project binding**: every PAT is bound to one project at creation time and
cannot be re-bound. Tasks submitted via the PAT land under that project;
uploaded files do too. If the bound project is later deleted, all submits
return 422 `token_project_unbound` — the user must revoke + recreate. See
`GET /v1/me` for the bound project info.

## Error envelope

All errors follow an OpenAI-style envelope so SDKs that parse that shape work
out of the box:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Missing required parameters: aspect_ratio, resolution",
    "type": "invalid_request_error",
    "code": "missing_required_params",
    "params": [
      {
        "id": "aspect_ratio", "type": "aspect_ratio", "required": true,
        "default": "1:1",
        "options": [{"value": "1:1", "label": "1:1"}, {"value": "16:9", "label": "16:9"}]
      },
      {
        "id": "resolution", "type": "resolution", "required": true,
        "default": "1024",
        "options": [{"value": "1024", "label": "1024 × 1024"}, ...]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

- `type` — broad family: `invalid_request_error`, `authentication_error`,
  `permission_error`, `rate_limit_error`, `api_error`.
- `code` — stable machine-readable reason. Branch on this in client code.
- `param` — set when the failure points at a single body / query field.
- Free-form extras (`validCategories`, `spent`, `cap`, `params`, `labels`, …)
  live under `error` too and are stable for any documented `code`.
- For `missing_required_params`, the `params` array carries structured hints
  per missing field (`id` / `type` / `required` / `default` / `options` /
  `constraints`) — agents can self-correct in one round-trip without
  re-fetching the model.

Per-endpoint error tables below.

## Endpoints

### `GET /v1/me`

PAT self-introspection. Returns everything the calling agent needs to plan
its requests without trial-and-error 429s / 402s — bound project, daily
credit headroom, account balance, current rate-limit numbers.

```bash
curl -fsS -H "Authorization: Bearer $ZOOOP_API_KEY" \
  "https://api.zooop.ai/v1/me"
```

Response:

```json
{
  "key": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "prefix": "zpk_live_aBcD…",
    "label": "claude-code-mac",
    "createdAt": "2026-05-15T10:00:00.000Z",
    "expiresAt": null,
    "dailyCreditCap": 1000,
    "creditsSpentToday": 42,
    "creditsRemainingToday": 958
  },
  "project": { "id": "uuid", "name": "My Project" },
  "user":    { "creditBalance": 84495 },
  "limits":  {
    "tasksPerMin": 60,
    "uploadsPerMin": 30,
    "uploadPollPerMin": 120
  }
}
```

Field notes:
- `key.dailyCreditCap` is `null` when no cap is set; `creditsRemainingToday`
  is also `null` in that case.
- `key.expiresAt` is `null` when the token never expires. Warn the user to
  renew before this date.
- `project.id` / `project.name` are both `null` (with `project.bound: false`)
  when the bound project was deleted — submits will fail with
  `token_project_unbound` until the token is rotated.
- `user.creditBalance` is the account-level wallet that funds tasks. Even
  with `creditsRemainingToday > 0`, an empty wallet still blocks expensive
  submits.
- `limits.*` reflect the current per-PAT rate-limit numbers. Honor them.

All PATs grant full access to every `/v1/*` endpoint.

Privacy: deliberately omits `user.id / email / name` (PAT bearer doesn't
need user identity — the token itself is the identity) and never enumerates
other PATs of the same user.

### `GET /v1/models?type=<type>&subtype=<subType>`

Lists the enabled model interfaces that match one `(type, subType)` pair.
Both query params are **required** — calling without them returns 400 plus
the full set of valid `(type, subType)` pairs so the caller can self-correct.

Exposure rule: a `(type, subType)` pair is exposed via the public API iff
the corresponding generator tool is currently in the homepage sidebar. The
single source of truth is `src/lib/seo/tool-pages-seo.ts` (`inSidebar: true`).

`typicalPrice.unit` values:

- `image` — credits per generated image (total at default dimensions)
- `second` — credits per second (output for duration-defaulted models, OR
  per second of input for extend / lipsync-style models)
- `frame` — credits per frame of input video
- `1k_chars` — credits per 1000 characters (TTS; all per-character pricing
  is normalized to this unit so the number is always a relatable integer
  / one-decimal value rather than a fractional per-char rate)
- `call` — credits per call (flat, no dimension scaling)

For flat units (`image`, `call`) `typicalCredits` is an integer and the
`minPrice` floor is already applied. For rate units (`second`, `frame`,
`1k_chars`) it may be fractional (e.g. `50.5`) to preserve fidelity for
sub-credit rates. `typicalPrice` is a coarse ballpark only — call
`POST /v1/quote` (below) with the exact payload you'd submit to get the
authoritative number.

### `GET /v1/ai-tools[?type=image|video]`

List active AI tools — admin-curated recipes that pre-bind a model + version
+ tuned params for a specific outcome (background removal, age modification,
style transfer, video upscale, etc.). Agents submit by stable `slug` and
supply only the recipe's visible inputs instead of configuring the raw
underlying interface.

Optional `?type=image|video` filters by media type. Other values return 400
`invalid_type`. There is **no** `subtype` query — the recipe's `subType`
field is admin free-form ("特效", "动作模仿") and not a filter axis.

Exposure rule: a tool appears iff (a) `recipe.isActive = true`, (b) the
recipe carries the `api` tag (admin opt-in — fail-closed by default), and
(c) its underlying interface is still enabled. This is a deliberately
narrow surface: most /tools/* recipes are prompt-wrappers around generic
text-to-image models that an agent could replicate cheaper by calling the
raw model directly. Only the tools that genuinely add capability beyond
`/v1/models` (background removal, upscalers, etc.) are tagged.

Response:

```json
{
  "aiTools": [
    {
      "slug": "background-removal",
      "name": "Background Removal",
      "mediaType": "image",
      "subType": "",
      "summary": "Remove the background and keep only the subject.",
      "coverUrl": "https://storage.zooop.ai/...",
      "tags": ["NEW"],
      "params": [
        { "id": "image_url", "type": "image_url", "required": true, "displayName": "" }
      ],
      "typicalPrice": { "typicalCredits": 2, "unit": "image" }
    },
    {
      "slug": "style-transfer",
      "name": "Style Transfer",
      "mediaType": "image",
      "params": [
        { "id": "image_url", "type": "image_url", "required": true },
        { "id": "target_style", "type": "enum", "required": true,
          "options": [
            { "value": "impressionism", "label": "Impressionism" },
            { "value": "cubism", "label": "Cubism" }
          ]
        },
        { "id": "aspect_ratio.ratio", "type": "aspect_ratio", "required": true,
          "options": ["1:1","16:9","9:16","4:3","3:4"] }
      ],
      "typicalPrice": { "typicalCredits": 6, "unit": "image" }
    }
  ]
}
```

The `params[]` shape mirrors `/v1/models` exactly — same `id` / `type` /
`required` / `options` / `default` / `constraints` semantics. Voice-type
params on TTS-style tools expand options to `{value, label, previewUrl?}`
identical to `/v1/models`. Fields the agent doesn't need (mapping internals,
preset overrides, hidden / fixed params) are stripped.

### `GET /v1/ai-tools/{slug}`

Fetch one AI tool by stable slug. Same shape as a single entry from the
list endpoint. Returns 404 `unknown_ai_tool` for unknown / inactive slugs
and for slugs whose interface is no longer enabled.

```bash
curl -fsS -H "Authorization: Bearer $ZOOOP_API_KEY" \
  "https://api.zooop.ai/v1/ai-tools/background-removal"
```

### `POST /v1/quote`

Price a hypothetical task without submitting. Same request body as
`POST /v1/tasks` (so an agent can reuse one payload for both calls).
No credits are charged, no DB row is created, no capacity is reserved —
safe to repeat freely.

Body — **one of two shapes**, mutually exclusive:

```json
// (a) Raw model
{
  "interfaceId": "<uuid from /models>",
  "versionId": "standard",
  "params": { "prompt": "…", "duration": 5 }
}

// (b) AI tool (curated recipe)
{
  "aiTool": "<slug from /ai-tools>",
  "params": { "image_url": "https://storage.zooop.ai/…" }
}
```

Sending both `aiTool` and `interfaceId` returns 400 `invalid_payload`.

Response:

```json
{
  "credits": 8,
  "estimatedSeconds": 18,
  "modelId": "uuid",
  "versionId": "standard",
  "modelName": "Kling V3",
  "breakdown": {
    "pricingKey": "720p",
    "base": 8,
    "multiplier": 1,
    "surcharges": 0,
    "basePrice": 0,
    "minPriceApplied": false
  }
}
```

- `credits` — authoritative cost for this exact payload. The `POST /v1/tasks`
  call WILL charge this number, provided input media durations don't change
  between quote and submit (media duration is part of the pricing basis).
- `estimatedSeconds` — P50 of the last 10 successful generations on this
  model. `null` when the model has no completion history yet.
- `breakdown` — itemised cost so the agent can explain "why" to the user:
  `final = max(minPrice, ceil(base × multiplier + surcharges + basePrice))`.

Errors mirror `POST /v1/tasks` for the same payload-validation paths
(`invalid_payload`, `missing_required_params`, `unknown_model`,
`model_not_public`). Quote also has its own `rate_limited` 429 (default
120 / min per token).

### `POST /v1/tasks`

Submit one generation task. Two body shapes are accepted — mutually exclusive.

Body — **raw model path**:

```json
{
  "interfaceId": "<uuid from /v1/models>",
  "versionId": "standard",
  "params": { "prompt": "…", "image_url": "…", "duration": 5 }
}
```

Body — **AI tool path** (curated recipe):

```json
{
  "aiTool": "<slug from /v1/ai-tools>",
  "params": { "image_url": "https://storage.zooop.ai/…" }
}
```

On the AI-tool path the server resolves slug → recipe → underlying
interfaceId + versionId, merges your `params` with the recipe's
fixedParams / defaultParams / customParams, validates the merged shape,
and applies the recipe's pricing override. The keys allowed in `params`
come from the tool's `params[]` spec returned by `/v1/ai-tools/{slug}`.

On the raw path, the keys come from the model's `params[]` spec returned
by `/v1/models`. Param values are validated server-side via the same path
the web `/api/ai/execute` route uses.

**Optional header** `Idempotency-Key: <≤256 chars>` — repeat submissions
with the same `(token, key)` within 24 hours return the original `taskId`
plus `"idempotent": true` instead of creating a duplicate. Stripe semantics.

Response:

```json
{ "taskId": "uuid", "status": "queued", "modelId": "...", "versionId": "..." }
```

Errors:

| HTTP | code                       | Cause                                       |
| ---- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 400  | `invalid_payload`          | Missing required input, bad shape, OR both `aiTool` and `interfaceId` set |
| 400  | `missing_required_params`  | Model `required: true` params absent; `error.params` lists each with type / options / default |

| 403  | `model_not_public`         | Raw-path model exists but isn't on the public API surface (does not apply to AI-tool path) |
| 403  | `account_banned`           | Token's owner is banned                     |
| 404  | `unknown_model`            | Bogus `interfaceId` or disabled model       |
| 404  | `unknown_ai_tool`          | Bogus `aiTool` slug, inactive recipe, or underlying interface disabled |
| 422  | `moderation_blocked`       | Text prompt failed content moderation       |
| 422  | `token_project_unbound`    | PAT's bound project was deleted — revoke + recreate |
| 429  | `rate_limited`             | Per-token rate-limit ceiling (default 60 req/min) |
| 429  | `token_daily_cap_reached`  | Token's `dailyCreditCap` already met before this call (coarse pre-check) |
| 503  | various                    | No enabled provider — pick a different model |

### `GET /v1/tasks/{id}`

Returns the current state of a task. Path-id is the `taskId` from submit.

```json
{
  "taskId": "uuid",
  "status": "succeeded",
  "outputs": [{ "url": "https://storage.zooop.ai/cdn-cgi/image/format=png,quality=95/.../uuid.webp",
                "thumbnailUrl": "https://storage.zooop.ai/cdn-cgi/image/format=png,quality=95/.../uuid-thumb.webp" }],
  "error": null,
  "creditsCharged": 4,
  "createdAt": "2026-05-14T01:23:45.000Z",
  "completedAt": "2026-05-14T01:24:12.000Z"
}
```

Public `status` values: `queued | running | succeeded | failed | cancelled`.
Internal granular states (`pending`, `processing`, `uploading`, `moderating`)
are collapsed into `running` since they're not actionable for agents.

**Image output URLs** are served via Cloudflare Image Transformations
(`cdn-cgi/image/format=png,quality=95`). The `format=png` is a soft hint
that Cloudflare honours selectively:

- Source has **alpha** (background-removal, transparent stickers) →
  response is **`image/png`** with transparency preserved.
- Source is fully **opaque** (typical t2i / i2i output) → Cloudflare
  downgrades to **`image/jpeg`** to keep delivery size small. This is
  Cloudflare's standard behaviour and there is no URL switch to override.

Either way the response `content-type` reflects the actual format. Trust
the header, not the URL pathname (which still ends in `.webp` — that's
the source-object key, not the delivered format). When saving locally,
pick the extension from `content-type`:

```bash
URL="https://storage.zooop.ai/cdn-cgi/image/format=png,quality=95/.../uuid.webp"
CT=$(curl -sI "$URL" | awk 'tolower($1)=="content-type:" {print $2}' | tr -d '\r')
EXT=$(case "$CT" in image/png) echo png;; image/jpeg) echo jpg;; *) echo bin;; esac)
curl -fL -o "out.$EXT" "$URL"
```

Video / audio URLs pass through unchanged.

### `POST /v1/uploads`

Upload a local file in a single request. The file content is the raw HTTP
body (NOT multipart). `Content-Type` selects the media type. Returns a
public URL ready to feed into a subsequent `/tasks` submission.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ZOOOP_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: image/png" \
  --data-binary @cat.png \
  https://api.zooop.ai/v1/uploads
```

The upload lands under the PAT's bound project (same path as Web UI uploads),
so it shows up in the "Uploads" tab of the in-app history picker and counts
toward your storage quota.

**Image / audio — synchronous response** (typically < 1s):

```json
{
  "status": "ready",
  "url": "https://storage.zooop.ai/<userId>/<projectId>/<uuid>.png",
  "size": 123456,
  "contentType": "image/png"
}
```

**Video — asynchronous via Aliyun video moderation**. Returns `202` with an
upload id:

```json
{
  "status": "processing",
  "uploadId": "<uuid>",
  "pollUrl": "/v1/uploads/<uuid>"
}
```

Poll `GET /v1/uploads/{uploadId}` until you get a terminal status.
Recommended cadence: 5s first poll, then 10–20s. Most clips resolve in
under a minute; the workflow has a 30-minute deadline.

**Image moderation block** (image content violates the policy):

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Uploaded content violates content policy",
    "type": "invalid_request_error",
    "code": "moderation_blocked",
    "labels": "porn"
  }
}
```
HTTP 451.

**Allowed Content-Type values**: `image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/webp`,
`image/gif`, `audio/mpeg`, `audio/wav`, `audio/webm`, `audio/ogg`,
`video/mp4`, `video/webm`, `video/quicktime`. Off-list values return 400
with the allowlist in the response.

**Size cap**: 100 MB (Cloudflare request-body limit). If you need to upload
something larger, use the Web UI then pass that URL to `/tasks`.

### `GET /v1/uploads/{uploadId}`

Poll the status of an async (video) upload returned by `POST /v1/uploads`.

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ZOOOP_API_KEY" \
  https://api.zooop.ai/v1/uploads/<uuid>
```

Response shapes:

```json
{ "status": "processing" }                                    # 202, still moderating
{ "status": "ready",   "url": "...", "contentType": "..." }   # 200, ready to use
{ "status": "blocked", "labels": "porn", "error": "..." }     # 200, rejected
{ "status": "errored", "reason": "..." }                       # 200, workflow gave up
```

Ownership: the upload id can only be polled by the PAT that created it.
Other tokens (even from the same user account) get 404 `unknown_upload`.

### `POST /v1/describe-image`

Analyse a reference image and return a structured prompt suitable for feeding
back into a generator (`subject` / `composition` / `style` / `lighting` /
`palette` / `mood` / `camera`, plus a single flowing `overallDescription`
paragraph).

Body:

```json
{ "imageUrl": "https://storage.zooop.ai/<userId>/<projectId>/<uuid>.png" }
```

- `imageUrl` is **required** and MUST be a ZOOOP CDN URL (i.e. one returned
  by `POST /v1/uploads`). Foreign URLs are rejected — this avoids SSRF and
  guarantees the input has already been moderated.

Response:

```json
{
  "credits": 1,
  "subject": "A young woman with light skin in her 20s",
  "composition": "Centered portrait, eye-level framing",
  "style": "Soft photographic realism with film grain",
  "lighting": "Warm window light from the left, gentle shadows",
  "palette": "Muted earth tones with desaturated greens",
  "mood": "Contemplative and serene",
  "camera": "Shot at 50mm with shallow depth of field",
  "overallDescription": "A young woman with light skin in her 20s, ..."
}
```

- `overallDescription` is the canonical "ready-to-use" field — drop it
  straight into a generator's `prompt` param. The other dimension fields
  are best-effort and may be empty strings depending on the active vision
  model. Treat `overallDescription` as the only field with strong stability.
- `credits: 1` is charged on success. Upstream / parse failures auto-refund.
- `camera` may be `null` for compositionally minimal images.

Errors:

## Limits

- **Rate limit** (per PAT, 60-second sliding window):
  - `POST /v1/tasks` — 60 req/min
  - `POST /v1/quote` — 120 req/min
  - `POST /v1/uploads` — 30 req/min
  - `GET /v1/uploads/{id}` — 120 req/min
  - `GET /v1/me` — 120 req/min
  - `GET /v1/ai-tools` and `GET /v1/ai-tools/{slug}` — 120 req/min
  - `POST /v1/describe-image` — 10 req/min (vision LLM is expensive)
  - `GET /v1/models`, `GET /v1/tasks/{id}` — unbounded
  - 429 responses carry `Retry-After` (seconds).
- **Tokens per user**: max 10 active. Revoke an old one to create a new one.
- **Daily credit cap (optional)**: per token; UTC-midnight rollover. Two
  enforcement points — coarse pre-check (`token_daily_cap_reached`, 429)
  and precise post-pricing check (`token_daily_cap_exceeded`, 402,
  prevents over-cap submission even when current spend < cap).
- **Concurrency**: per-user `maxConcurrency` (default 3) caps how many
  PAT-submitted tasks run in parallel — excess queues in FIFO order and
  drains as earlier tasks complete. Rate-limit and concurrency are
  orthogonal: you can submit 60/min but only 3 will execute at once.
- **Content moderation**: identical to web — Aliyun text moderation runs
  before credit deduction; AIGC image outputs are moderated post-generation;
  uploaded images are moderated synchronously on `POST /v1/uploads`;
  uploaded videos are moderated asynchronously via the poll route.
- **Upload size**: 100 MB hard ceiling per file (Cloudflare request-body
  limit). Larger files: use the Web UI and pass the URL.

## Out of scope

- **Team / organization workspaces**: PATs are personal-only.
- **Project management**: PATs are bound to one project at creation. To
  switch projects, revoke and create a new token.
- **Canvases / story timeline**: the API exposes single-shot generation only.
- **Streaming progress**: poll instead.
- **Listing tasks / uploads**: no `/tasks?since=` or `/uploads?since=`
  endpoints — track task IDs client-side.

## Transient errors — what to retry, how to diagnose

A single failed request often has nothing to do with the API. Retry the
transient class with exponential backoff before declaring an outage.

**Retry (transient, usually self-heals):**
- TCP / TLS errors with no HTTP status — `ECONNRESET`, `EAI_AGAIN`, curl
  exit codes `6` (DNS), `7` (connect), `35` / `52` / `56` (TLS / recv).
- HTTP `502` / `503` / `504`.
- HTTP `429` — honor `Retry-After`.
- Cloudflare `520`–`526`.

**Do NOT retry:**
- Other `4xx` (auth / validation — retry won't help).
- `451 moderation_blocked` — same bytes will be rejected again.
- `422 token_project_unbound` — bound project deleted; user must rotate
  the token.

**Pattern:** up to 3 attempts, exponential backoff 1s → 3s → 9s, honor
`Retry-After`. If all 3 fail, surface the error.

**Diagnostic before declaring outage:**

```bash
curl -fsS -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" https://zooop.ai
curl -fsS -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" https://api.zooop.ai/llms.txt
```

If `zooop.ai` is up but `api.zooop.ai` keeps failing, only THEN report an
outage — otherwise it's almost always local network or transient.
